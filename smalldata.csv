ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here

And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights

You will have no time for grieving

And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle

Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""

Aerosmith,Blind Man,/a/aerosmith/blind+man_20004145.html,"I took a course in hallelujah  
I went to night school for the blues  
I took some stuff they said would cool ya  
But nothing seemed to light my fuse  
But it's all in the past  
Like a check that's in the mail  
She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes  
Because here comes the sun  
Ain't no surprise  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Gonna open up your eyes

Aerosmith,Draw The Line,/a/aerosmith/draw+the+line_20004388.html,"Checkmate honey, beat ya at your own damn game  
No dice honey, I'm livin' on the astral plane  
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain  
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind  
Where to draw the line  
An Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor  
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store  
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me  
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time  
Know where to draw the line  
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs  
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long  
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime  
No dice honey, you're the salt, you're the queen of the brine  
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose  
Where to draw the line  
  
Checkmate, don't be late  
Take another pull  
That's right  
Impossible  
When you got to be yourself  
You're the boss, the toss  
The price, the dice  
Grab yourself a slice  
Know where to draw the line

Aerosmith,Eat The Rich,/a/aerosmith/eat+the+rich_20004281.html,"Well I woke up this morning  
On the wrong side of the bed  
And how I got to thinkin'  
About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin' names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
'cause I'm sick of your complainin'  
About how many bills  
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just can't see no humor  
About your way of life  
And I think I can do more for you  
With this here fork and knife  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
So I called up my head shrinker  
And I told him what I'd done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah, I hope you have some fun  
And a don't go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
'Cause you won't get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But there's one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Believe in all the good things  
That money just can't buy  
Then you won't get no bellyache  
From eatin' humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance won't last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
Don't stop me now, I'm goin' crazy  
Eat the rich  
That's my idea of a good time baby
