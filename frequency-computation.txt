The main goal is that we do not save entire file in memory.
In mapper, we can create new variable 'size' representing total # of n-grams.
Every time we print pair word\t1, we simply do size += 1
then prints the size in form 0\tsize before termination
(For simplicity I wrote 0 but any character that goes before [a-zA-Z0-9_] will make this work
as in case of having 0 as actual input word 0 will not work.)
Then before sort phase, we obtain
word1 1
word2 1
word3 1
.

a size

In sort phase, a size (where a should be any character that comes before [a-zA-Z0-9_] for sort)
will be the first one to be read, and such that when we run reduce,
we simply read first line before loop and save the size
For every print, we print "word count/size" instead of "word count"
which will give us frequency.
