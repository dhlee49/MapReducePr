The main goal is that we do not save entire file in memory.
In mapper, we can create new variable 'size' representing total # of n-grams.
2 choices for us.
1) Write size variable into a file so that reducers can access (simply open file and read that)
2) Use zookeeper to keep size as configuration info(More versatile, but require use of other application)
2*) Zookeeper is centralized service that can be used in other distributed application for keeping
  configuration information(in this case size!),naming, synchronizing,and group service.
